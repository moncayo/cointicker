# CoinTicker
CoinTicker is a web app that tracks cryptocurrency prices across all major exchanges. For a given coin, the site will display the top 10 exchanges in volume, sorted from highest price to lowest, and a 24 hour range chart using the CoinGecko API. Clicking the exchange name will send you to the coin/USD pairing on that exchange (if available).

Sell high, buy low!
